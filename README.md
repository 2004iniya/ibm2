This repository contains code for predicting electricity prices using machine learning models.

## Overview

This project aims to forecast electricity prices using historical data and machine learning algorithms. The predictive models are based on [brief explanation of methodology or models used].

## Dependencies

To run the code, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (version x.x)
- Libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- (Any other libraries or packages used in the code)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone(https://github.com/2004iniya/ibm2.git)/electricity-price-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

Prepare your electricity price dataset in a CSV format. The dataset should contain columns such as 'Date', 'Time', 'Price', etc. Ensure the data is cleaned and formatted appropriately.

2. **Training the Model:**

Run the training script and provide the path to your prepared dataset:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset.csv
```

This script will train the model using the provided data and save the trained model to a specified location.

3. **Making Predictions:**

Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new data using:

```bash
python predict.py --model_path /path/to/your/saved_model.pkl --input_data /path/to/your/new_data.csv
```

This script will load the trained model and make predictions on the new dataset.

## File Structure

- `train.py`: Python script to train the machine learning model.
- `predict.py`: Script to make predictions using the trained model.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used in training and prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the Python dependencies.
